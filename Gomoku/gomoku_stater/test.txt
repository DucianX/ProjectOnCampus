Which functions you tested for Part 1
    I tested the is_occupied and record_location functions that detect if the spot is occupied by a stone.
    I also tested that if the status of all the locations is initialized as False.
    Plus the function to get deviated inputs back to the intersection, even the board.

A summary of valid inputs (inputs for which you’d expect a ‘good’ result) and expected return values
    Initially, all the spots were marked False, which I expected. 
    And I created a stone and recorded it. The occupied method returned True.
    A pair of (x, y) has been successfully

A summary of invalid inputs (inputs for which you’d expect a ‘bad’ result) and expected return values
    I try to test a place that is empty. The function returned False as I expected.
    I also tried to get a pair of (x, y) to a wrong intersection. Returned False as expected.

Whether you’re confident you’ve verified every reasonable eventuality
    Yeah, kind of. Because I tested its graphic parts in processing I guess everything will be fine then.

Whether your testing revealed any bugs that you then went back and fixed.
    Not yet.
